# HCL-PROJECT
## Overview:
I have devised a project centered around real-time age detection using image processing in Java. Upon execution, the application triggers the webcam, identifies faces, highlights them, and showcases the estimated ages, leveraging sophisticated Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) technology that I implemented.
## Features:
1)Real-time webcam activation and face detection. 2)Precise age prediction using CNN. 3)Accurate face outlining for visual representation. 4)Suitable for diverse applications: retail, security, demographic analysis, and more.
## Necessities for project execution:
## 1)Hardware requirements:
## Webcam: A high-quality webcam capable of capturing clear and detailed images for face detection.
Processor: Multi-core processor (e.g., Intel Core i5 or higher) for efficient real-time image processing.
## RAM: Minimum 8 GB RAM for smooth execution of image processing and machine learning tasks.
## Storage: Adequate storage space for storing the application, libraries, and captured images or videos.
## Operating System: Platform-independent, compatible with Windows, macOS, or Linux for wider user accessibility.
## 2)Software Requirements:
## Integrated Development Environment (IDE):
You can use any Java-compatible Integrated Development Environment (IDE) like IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or Visual Studio Code for writing and debugging code. The suggested choice is Visual Studio Code (VsCode).
## Java Development Kit (JDK):
JDK 8 or higher for Java application development.(Preffered version : JDK 17)
## OpenCV Library:
Utilize OpenCV in Java to employ computer vision algorithms and perform image processing tasks. For the preferred version, please download "opencv-4.8.0-windows" from the following link: "https://opencv.org/releases/".
## Deep Learning Framework: 
TensorFlow or a similar deep learning framework for implementing the CNN model for age prediction.
## Computer Neural Networks is being taken refference from "https://talhassner.github.io/home/publication/2015_CVPR"
## Maven Installations: "https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi" (Suggested: apache-maven-3.9.4-bin)
## Compiling Project: In order to build this project, run a mvn clean install at the project root.
